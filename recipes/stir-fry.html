    <h2>The recipe for the Stir-Fry</h2>
    <p>
        Stir frying is a cooking technique in which ingredients are fried in a small amount of very hot oil while being stirred or tossed in a wok. 
        The technique originated in China and in recent centuries has spread into other parts of Asia and the West.
